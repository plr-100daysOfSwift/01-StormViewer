# StormViewer
Hacking with Swift: 100 Days of Swift - Project 1

## Challenge

1. Use Interface Builder to select the text label inside your table view cell and adjust its font size to something larger – experiment and see what looks good.
2. In your main table view, show the image names in sorted order, so “nssl0033.jpg” comes before “nssl0034.jpg”.
3. Rather than show image names in the detail title bar, show “Picture X of Y”, where Y is the total number of images and X is the selected picture’s position in the array. Make sure you count from 1 rather than 0.

## Project 12 Challenge 1

1. Modify  Project 1 so that it remembers how many times each storm image was shown – you don’t need to show it anywhere, but you’re welcome to try modifying your original copy of project 1 to show the view count as a subtitle below each image name in the table view.
